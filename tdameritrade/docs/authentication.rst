Authentication
===============
TD Ameritrade requires an OAuth token. It is somewhat laborious to get this, but parts have been automated here with selenium. 


Steps
======


Step 1
-------

Navigate and register/login to the `TD Developer page<https://developer.tdameritrade.com>`_.

Step 2
--------
Navigate to My Apps

    :scale: 100%
    :alt: auth1.png


Step 3
-------
Create a new one


Step 4
--------
Set the name and id to something reasonably unique, and the redirect to ``http://localhost:8080`` for now.


Step 5
-------
run ``tdameritrade.auth.authentication`` from a python prompt, with ``client_id=consumer_key`` and ``redirect_uri`` from step 4.

Step 6
-------
Sign in and authorize your app.

You can enter credentials by hand or store them in environment variables ``TDAUSER`` and ``TDAPASS``. When stored, the first page will be filled in and advanced automaticly. 

.. image:: ./img/auth/2.png
    :scale: 100%
    :alt: auth2.png

.. image:: ./img/auth/3.png
    :scale: 100%
    :alt: auth3.png

Step 7
-------
Return to the prompt, if you entered the info correctly you should see your tokens printed. Write these down, i recommend keeping a ``keys.sh`` file setting ``ACCESS_TOKEN`` and ``REFRESH_TOKEN`` environment variables. 

.. image:: ./img/auth/4.png
    :scale: 100%
